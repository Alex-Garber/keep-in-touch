> As a  millienial, I want to respond to my friends, acquaintances, and work connections in a timely manner so I can build my social network and create deeper, more meaningful connections with the people I've met. This app will help me for the times I become too forgetful or busy.

> As a college graduate, I can barely handle \#adulting. I want an easy way to check all my old messages to make sure I didn't forget to message my friends back, so that I can quickly stay on top of my messages while I learn how to manage paying bills and cooking. 

#### Parents ![Parents](../img/parents2.jpg)

> As a forgetful parent, I want to check in on my family more often to make sure they have everything they need. By using KiT, I wont have to worry if I forget about them when work or taking care of my younger kids gets hectic, because I'll be reminded to send a _**KiT**_.

#### Grandparents ![Grandparents](../img/grandparents.jpg)

> As a grandparent, I want to let my family know that I'm okay every so often. However, I can't navigate apps. I want a basic app that helps me _keep in touch_, so my family doesn't worry about me, but also remembers to call me back.
