## Current state of Kit:

## Needs to be able to:
* read in text messages through intents

* needs access to contact information/ permission through intents

* needs a way to display, send, and select one out of a set of quick replies for different user types


## Cosmetic improvements:
* For style, and aesthetics it would be nice to add images in the background of the app,
 and to make sure the color scheming is consistent throughout.

## Stretch Goals:
* It would be really great to make use of the Google MLKit machine learning software, so that AutoReplies 
can be generated by the last text message sent into the app.
