* Teens-- particularly,  for those who use social media and messaging platforms, but struggle with social-anxiety
> As a young teen, I want to text my friends back more often, so that  I can stay better connected and grow my relationships with them. I also don't want to feel FOMO, so I think this app will help me step past the "over-thinking" in my head and lead to more interactions digitally and eventually in-person.

* Millenials-- particularly,  for those who have just graduated college or live on their own and are working a busy job in a new city
> As a  millienial, I want to respond to my friends, acquaintances, and work connections in a timely manner to build my social network and create deeper and more meaningful connections with the individuals I've met throughout my life. This app will help me for the times I become too forgetful or busy.

* Parents-- particularly, for those who want to go above and beyond in parenting duties and realize that it's quite hard to manage a family  
> As a forgetful parent, I want to check in on my family more often to make sure they have everything they need. By using KiT, I wont have to worry if I forget about them when work or taking care of my younger kids gets hectic, because I'll be reminded to send a _**KiT**_.

* Grandparents-- particularly, for those hip grannies and gramps that are adventurous and like to do things on their own
> As a grandparent, I want to let my children and grandchildren know that I'm okay every so often. However, I can't handle these new-fangled devices. I want a basic app that helps me, so my family doesn't have to worry about me. Hopefully they'll also remember to call me back more often too.
